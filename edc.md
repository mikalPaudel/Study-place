# CHAPTER-1 [Diodes]
### **1. The Ideal Diode**
An **ideal diode** acts as a perfect switch:
- **Forward Bias (ON state)**: When the anode is more positive than the cathode, the diode conducts current with zero resistance.
- **Reverse Bias (OFF state)**: When the anode is less positive than the cathode, the diode blocks current completely.

However, real diodes have a small forward voltage drop (≈0.7V for silicon diodes) and leakage current in reverse bias.

### **2. Terminal Characteristics of Junction Diodes**
A **junction diode** has three regions in its **I-V characteristics**:
- **Forward Region:** The diode conducts current when \( V > V_{threshold} \) (≈0.7V for silicon, 0.3V for germanium).
- **Reverse Region:** The diode blocks current, except for a small leakage current.
- **Breakdown Region:** If reverse voltage exceeds the **breakdown voltage**, the diode conducts heavily (used in Zener diodes).

### **3. Physical Operation of Diodes**
Diodes are made of **p-n junctions**, where:
- The **p-side** has excess holes.
- The **n-side** has excess electrons.
- When connected in forward bias, charge carriers move across the junction, allowing current flow.

### **4. Analysis of Diode Circuits**
To analyze diode circuits:
1. **Assume the diode state** (ON or OFF).
2. **Check consistency** with circuit equations.
3. **Use models**:
   - Ideal diode model (perfect switch).
   - Constant voltage drop model (0.7V for silicon).
   - Small-signal model (for AC analysis).

### **5. Small Signal Model and Its Application**
For small AC signals, we approximate the diode behavior with a **resistance \( r_d \)** given by:
\[
r_d = \frac{nV_T}{I_D}
\]
where \( V_T \) is the thermal voltage (~26mV at room temp) and \( I_D \) is the DC operating current.

### **6. Operation in the Reverse Breakdown Region - Zener Diodes**
- **Zener diodes** are designed to operate in breakdown without damage.
- They provide a stable reference voltage in **voltage regulation circuits**.
- **Zener breakdown** occurs at low voltages (<5V), while **avalanche breakdown** occurs at higher voltages.

---

# CHAPTER-2 [BJT]
### **2. Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT)**  

A **Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT)** is a three-terminal device (Base, Collector, and Emitter) used for amplification and switching. It comes in two types:  
- **npn (more commonly used)**  
- **pnp**  

#### **1. Operation of the npn Transistor in the Active Mode**  
In an **npn transistor**, current flows from the collector to the emitter when:  
- The **base-emitter junction** is forward biased (\( V_{BE} \approx 0.7V \))  
- The **collector-base junction** is reverse biased  

This allows a small **base current (\( I_B \))** to control a much larger **collector current (\( I_C \))**, making the transistor an amplifier. The current relation is:  
\[
I_C = \beta I_B
\]
where **\( \beta \)** (current gain) typically ranges from **20 to 500**.

---

#### **2. Graphical Representation of Transistor Characteristics**  
A **BJT's behavior** is shown in **I-V characteristic curves** with three regions:  
1. **Cutoff Region** (\( I_B = 0 \)): No current flows. The transistor is OFF.  
2. **Active Region** (\( V_{CE} > V_{BE} \)): Transistor acts as an amplifier.  
3. **Saturation Region** (\( V_{CE} \) is very low): Maximum current flows. The transistor is fully ON (switching mode).  

The characteristic curves plot **\( I_C \) vs. \( V_{CE} \)** for different base currents.

---

#### **3. Analysis of Transistor Circuits at DC**  
To analyze a transistor circuit at **DC**, follow these steps:  
1. **Assume the region** (Active, Cutoff, or Saturation).  
2. **Apply Kirchhoff’s Laws**:  
   - **Base-Emitter Loop**:  
     \[
     V_{BE} = 0.7V \quad \text{(for silicon BJT)}
     \]
   - **Collector-Emitter Loop**:  
     \[
     V_{CE} = V_C - V_E
     \]
3. **Use the current relations**:  
   - \( I_C = \beta I_B \)  
   - \( I_E = I_B + I_C \)

---

#### **4. Transistor as an Amplifier**  
A **BJT amplifier** increases the strength of an input signal. The gain depends on the circuit configuration:  
- **Common Emitter (CE):** High gain, phase inversion.  
- **Common Base (CB):** Low input impedance, high voltage gain.  
- **Common Collector (CC, or Emitter Follower):** High input impedance, no voltage gain.  

**Voltage Gain Formula (CE Amplifier):**  
\[
A_v = \frac{V_{\text{out}}}{V_{\text{in}}} = -\beta \left( \frac{R_C}{r_e} \right)
\]
where \( r_e \) is the small-signal emitter resistance.

---

#### **5. Small Signal Equivalent Circuit Models**  
For AC analysis, BJTs are replaced with **small-signal equivalent circuits**, such as:  
- **Hybrid-\( \pi \) Model**: Uses parameters like \( r_\pi \) (input resistance), \( g_m \) (transconductance).  
- **T-Model**: Emphasizes emitter resistance.

The **transconductance** is:  
\[
g_m = \frac{I_C}{V_T}, \quad V_T \approx 26mV \text{ (at room temp)}
\]

---

#### **6. Graphical Load Line Analysis**  
The **load line** is a graphical method to analyze BJT behavior in a circuit. It represents the circuit equation:  
\[
V_{CE} = V_{CC} - I_C R_C
\]  
By plotting it on the **I-V curve**, we find the **Q-point (operating point)** where the transistor works efficiently.

---

#### **7. Biasing BJT for Discrete-Circuit Design**  
To keep the transistor in the **active region**, we need **biasing circuits** like:  
- **Fixed Biasing** (\( V_B \) is fixed)  
- **Voltage Divider Biasing** (More stable, widely used)  
- **Emitter Biasing** (Uses \( R_E \) for better stability)  

A **voltage divider bias circuit** sets \( V_B \) with:  
\[
V_B = V_{CC} \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}
\]

---

#### **8. Basic Single-Stage BJT Amplifier Configurations**  
- **Common Base (CB):** Low input impedance, high voltage gain.  
- **Common Emitter (CE):** High gain, inverts signal.  
- **Common Collector (CC, or Emitter Follower):** High input impedance, no voltage gain, useful as a buffer.

---

#### **9. Transistor as a Switch (Cutoff and Saturation Mode)**  
- **Cutoff Mode**: \( I_B = 0 \), transistor OFF.  
- **Saturation Mode**: \( V_{CE} \approx 0.2V \), transistor fully ON.  

Used in **digital logic circuits** and **power switching**.

---

#### **10. A General Large-Signal Model for the BJT: The Ebers-Moll Model**  
The **Ebers-Moll Model** describes **BJT behavior at all operating points** (active, saturation, cutoff). It uses two **diode equations** and **current-controlled current sources** to model the device accurately.

---

# CHAPTER-3 [FET-MOSFET]
### **3. Field-Effect Transistor (FET) - MOSFET**  

A **Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET)** is a **voltage-controlled** device that regulates current flow using an **electric field**. It is widely used in **digital circuits, amplifiers, and power electronics** due to its high input impedance and low power consumption.

---

## **1. Structure and Physical Operation of Enhancement-Type MOSFET**  
MOSFETs have **three terminals**:  
- **Gate (G)** - Voltage applied here controls current flow.  
- **Drain (D)** - The terminal where current exits.  
- **Source (S)** - The terminal where current enters.  

A MOSFET has four layers:  
1. **Substrate** (usually p-type for n-channel MOSFETs).  
2. **Oxide Layer** (insulator, prevents gate current flow).  
3. **Gate Electrode** (applies electric field).  
4. **Drain & Source** (heavily doped n+ regions for current flow).  

### **How It Works:**  
- **When \( V_{GS} = 0V \):** No current flows (OFF state).  
- **When \( V_{GS} > V_{th} \):** An **inversion layer (channel)** forms, allowing current between **Drain** and **Source**.  
- The strength of this channel depends on \( V_{GS} \).  

---

## **2. Current-Voltage Characteristics of Enhancement-Type MOSFET**  
The **drain current (\( I_D \))** depends on **Gate-Source Voltage (\( V_{GS} \))** and **Drain-Source Voltage (\( V_{DS} \))**.  

### **Operating Regions:**  
1. **Cutoff Region:**  
   - \( V_{GS} < V_{th} \) → MOSFET is OFF, \( I_D = 0 \).  
2. **Triode (Linear) Region:**  
   - \( V_{GS} > V_{th} \) and \( V_{DS} < V_{GS} - V_{th} \)  
   - Acts like a variable resistor.  
   - Drain current:  
     \[
     I_D = k \left[ (V_{GS} - V_{th}) V_{DS} - \frac{V_{DS}^2}{2} \right]
     \]  
3. **Saturation (Active) Region:**  
   - \( V_{DS} > V_{GS} - V_{th} \)  
   - Acts as an amplifier.  
   - Drain current:  
     \[
     I_D = \frac{k}{2} (V_{GS} - V_{th})^2
     \]  
   where \( k = \frac{\mu_n C_{ox} W}{L} \) (transconductance parameter).  

---

## **3. The Depletion-Type MOSFET**  
Unlike enhancement MOSFETs, **depletion-type MOSFETs**:  
- Conduct even when \( V_{GS} = 0 \) (Normally ON).  
- Need a **negative \( V_{GS} \)** (for n-channel) to turn OFF.  
- Have similar **I-V characteristics** but can operate with negative gate voltages.  

---

## **4. MOSFET Circuits at DC**  
To analyze MOSFET circuits:  
1. **Assume an operating region** (Cutoff, Triode, or Saturation).  
2. **Apply Kirchhoff’s Laws** to solve for voltages/currents.  
3. **Use transistor equations** for confirmation.  

For example, in **self-bias circuits**, a resistor sets \( V_G \), and source resistance \( R_S \) helps stabilize biasing.

---

## **5. MOSFET as an Amplifier**  
MOSFETs are widely used as **voltage amplifiers** due to high input impedance.  

- **Voltage Gain:**  
  \[
  A_v = -g_m R_D
  \]
  where \( g_m \) (transconductance) is:  
  \[
  g_m = \frac{dI_D}{dV_{GS}} = \frac{2I_D}{V_{GS} - V_{th}}
  \]  
- Unlike BJTs, **MOSFET amplifiers have no input current**, making them ideal for high-impedance applications.  

---

## **6. Biasing in MOS Amplifier Circuits**  
Biasing ensures stable operation. Common biasing techniques include:  
- **Voltage-Divider Bias** (Most stable).  
- **Zero-Bias** (For depletion MOSFETs).  
- **Self-Bias** (Uses \( R_S \) to stabilize \( I_D \)).  

---

## **7. Junction Field-Effect Transistor (JFET)**  
**JFETs** are another type of **FET** but have a **reverse-biased p-n junction** instead of an insulated gate.  
- **n-channel JFET** has **p-type Gate** and **n-type channel**.  
- **p-channel JFET** has **n-type Gate** and **p-type channel**.  

**Current in JFETs is controlled by reverse-biasing the Gate, reducing the channel width.**  
- \( I_D = I_{DSS} \left( 1 - \frac{V_{GS}}{V_P} \right)^2 \)  
- \( V_P \) is the **pinch-off voltage** where conduction stops.  

---

CHAPTER-4 [Power Amplifiers]
### **4. Output Stages and Power Amplifiers**

---

## **1. Classification of Output Stages**  
Power amplifiers are classified based on their conduction angle (\( \theta \))—the portion of the input cycle during which current flows.  

| Class | Conduction Angle | Efficiency | Application |
|-------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Class A** | \( 360^\circ \) (full cycle) | ~25-30% | High-fidelity audio |
| **Class B** | \( 180^\circ \) (half cycle) | ~78.5% | Push-pull circuits |
| **Class AB** | \( 180^\circ < \theta < 360^\circ \) | ~50-70% | Balanced efficiency & distortion |
| **Class C** | \( <180^\circ \) | ~80% | RF transmitters |
| **Class D** | Digital switching (PWM) | ~90% | High-efficiency power amplifiers |

---

## **2. Class A Output Stage**  
- The **simplest** but **least efficient** amplifier.  
- The transistor remains **ON throughout the cycle** → **high linearity but low efficiency**.

**Example: Single-ended Class A amplifier**  
- Uses a **single transistor** and a **resistor or transformer load**.  
- **Biasing ensures the transistor stays in the active region** for the entire cycle.

  \[
  P_{\text{diss}} = V_{CC} I_C
  \]  

---

## **3. Class B Output Stage**  
- Uses **two complementary transistors (NPN + PNP)** in a **push-pull configuration**.  
- Each transistor conducts for **half the cycle** → Efficiency is **higher (~78.5%)**.  
- **Issue: Crossover Distortion**  
  - Near zero input, both transistors turn off briefly, causing distortion.  
  - Fixed by adding a small bias voltage (**Class AB operation**).  

**Power efficiency** is given by:  
\[
\eta = \frac{\pi}{4} \approx 78.5\%
\]

---

## **4. Class AB Output Stage**  
- **Hybrid between Class A and Class B**.  
- A **small bias voltage** is applied to keep both transistors **slightly ON**, reducing **crossover distortion**.  
- Efficiency is **higher than Class A (~50-70%)** but **better linearity than Class B**.  

---

## **5. Class C Output Stage**  
- **Very high efficiency (~80%)** but **high distortion**.  
- Conduction angle **< 180°** (only a small part of the signal is amplified).  
- Used in **RF applications (radio transmitters, oscillators)**.  

---

## **6. Biasing the Class AB Stage**  
- Uses **diodes or biasing resistors** to keep transistors ON just before crossover.  
- Example: **V_BE multiplier (Biasing network)** is used to set a stable operating point.  

---

## **7. Power BJTs**  
Power BJTs are specially designed for high **current and voltage handling**. Features:  
- **Larger junction area** (to dissipate heat).  
- **Low-frequency response** (optimized for power, not speed).  
- Used in **audio amplifiers, motor drivers, and power supplies**.  

---

## **8. Transformer-Coupled Push-Pull Stages**

  - **Match impedance** (for max power transfer).  
  - **Provide isolation**.  
  - **Improve efficiency**.  
- Example: **Push-Pull Class B amplifier with a center-tapped transformer**.  

---
