# CHAPTER-1 [Diodes]
### **1. The Ideal Diode**
An **ideal diode** acts as a perfect switch:
- **Forward Bias (ON state)**: When the anode is more positive than the cathode, the diode conducts current with zero resistance.
- **Reverse Bias (OFF state)**: When the anode is less positive than the cathode, the diode blocks current completely.

However, real diodes have a small forward voltage drop (≈0.7V for silicon diodes) and leakage current in reverse bias.

### **2. Terminal Characteristics of Junction Diodes**
A **junction diode** has three regions in its **I-V characteristics**:
- **Forward Region:** The diode conducts current when \( V > V_{threshold} \) (≈0.7V for silicon, 0.3V for germanium).
- **Reverse Region:** The diode blocks current, except for a small leakage current.
- **Breakdown Region:** If reverse voltage exceeds the **breakdown voltage**, the diode conducts heavily (used in Zener diodes).

### **3. Physical Operation of Diodes**
Diodes are made of **p-n junctions**, where:
- The **p-side** has excess holes.
- The **n-side** has excess electrons.
- When connected in forward bias, charge carriers move across the junction, allowing current flow.

### **4. Analysis of Diode Circuits**
To analyze diode circuits:
1. **Assume the diode state** (ON or OFF).
2. **Check consistency** with circuit equations.
3. **Use models**:
   - Ideal diode model (perfect switch).
   - Constant voltage drop model (0.7V for silicon).
   - Small-signal model (for AC analysis).

### **5. Small Signal Model and Its Application**
For small AC signals, we approximate the diode behavior with a **resistance \( r_d \)** given by:
\[
r_d = \frac{nV_T}{I_D}
\]
where \( V_T \) is the thermal voltage (~26mV at room temp) and \( I_D \) is the DC operating current.

### **6. Operation in the Reverse Breakdown Region - Zener Diodes**
- **Zener diodes** are designed to operate in breakdown without damage.
- They provide a stable reference voltage in **voltage regulation circuits**.
- **Zener breakdown** occurs at low voltages (<5V), while **avalanche breakdown** occurs at higher voltages.
